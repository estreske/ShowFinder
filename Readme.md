#ShowFinder

Showfinder is a Rails app designed and developed by Eric Streske.  The concept of the site is to assist touring musicians in booking shows in markets/cities where they are relatively unknown.  Users can input their shows into the ShowFinder database and other users can browse those shows and submit a request to be put on the bill.  As a former touring musician who has done tour booking, I understand how frustrating it can be to find shows in cities where you have never been.  I hope that ShowFinder can foster relationships between touring acts and lead to a wider variety of opportunities for acts that are booking tours without the use of an agent or manager.  

##Gems and APIs

ShowFinder uses the Google Maps API v3 and the Geocoder Ruby gem, and is built in Rails 3.2.16.  

##Heroku

ShowFinder will be hosted on Heroku and the URL will be coming soon.
